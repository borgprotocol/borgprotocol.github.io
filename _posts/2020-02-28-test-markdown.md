This is the beginning of working on a project that will last the test of time. There is no roadmap but an objective. Borg Protocol is to make a solid stance in the crypto community, but only when a real utility for it is found and is sustaainable.
A top level chain, sidechain or para chain has not been decided as of yet. But a neccessity for utility has.
